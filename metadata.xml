    <description>Only for AB+.

UPDATE - Now working with GREED Mode

A mod to The Binding of Isaac, making that first Treasure Room contains an item of at least 3 Quality.

There are mods like that, but they do not work with AB+. That's because Quality attribute was added in Repentance and (I think) all of these mods use them. This one works tho.

Have an improvement? https://github.com/D00NIK/Starterr</description>
